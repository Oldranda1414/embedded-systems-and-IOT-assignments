In the same folder as this schemaLegend.txt there are two schemas.

They are different only in the colors of the cables
IRLSchema.png has cables of the same colors shown in the video testVideo.mp4
IdealSchema has cables of colors that reflect their use

In both schemas pi cables are used where the drawing tool made them necessary, but they were not used in the video testVideo.mp4 as the components (resistors and leds) were directly inserted in the breadboard pins 

The following legend refers to IdealSchema

Legend

black cable = ground
red cable = 5V from arduino
orange cable = red led input
yellow cable = green leds input
green cable = buttons output
blue cable = potentiometer output
pink cable = part of the wire of the component, added because of tinkercad limitations
